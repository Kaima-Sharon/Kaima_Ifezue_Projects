# 🍲 Naija Soul Food

**Naija Soul Food** is a responsive, one-stop online menu and order platform for a home-based Nigerian food business. This project was designed and built by Kaima Ifezue, a Software Engineering student at the **University of Guelph**, combining creativity with practical frontend skills.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This website allows customers to:
- Browse a delicious variety of Nigerian dishes (Jollof rice, Egusi soup, Suya, and more)
- View pricing and dish descriptions
- Add items to a cart
- Submit an order (to be paid by Interac e-Transfer upon pickup or delivery)

> This project reflects both my technical development and cultural passion, representing the intersection of food, design, and code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** & **CSS3** — page structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** — form logic and interactivity (minimal for now, no framework)  
- **Google Fonts & Material Icons** — for visual personality  
- **Responsive Design** — layout adjusts to various screen sizes  
- **Git & GitHub** — version control and collaboration

## 📁 Features Implemented

- Custom navigation banner with logo and icons
- Interactive cart page (form-based, non-JS fallback ready)
- Gradient background + faded hero sections
- Organized category-based menu with pricing
- Contact footer and placeholder for future backend integration

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add full order handling with backend (Node.js or Firebase)
- Save cart state between sessions
- Include order confirmation messages or receipts
- Admin dashboard to manage orders

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
- I would like to thank my aunt, Christine Adeyemi, for trusting me to give her home-based business a platform for others to learn and interact with.

Built with ❤️ by Kaima, a software engineering student with a taste for code and culture.
